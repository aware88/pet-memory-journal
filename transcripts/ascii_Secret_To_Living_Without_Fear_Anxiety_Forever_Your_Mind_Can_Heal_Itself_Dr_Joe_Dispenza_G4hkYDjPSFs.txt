75 to 90% of every person that walks into a healthc care facility in the Western World walks in because of emotional or psychological stress we also know that people become addicted to the stress hormones to those emotions and then they need the bad job they need the bad relationship they need the traffic they need the news just so that they can stay in that emotional state but now you're headed for disease because no organism can live in emergency mode for that extended period of time but I literally can give people the tools to be able to break those emotional addictions and our data shows it works better than any drug Dr Joe dispenza is a world leading voice on the power of the Mind whose groundbreaking research has unlocked a practical formula to empower millions of people to rewire their minds and create longlasting change if I'm looking to change my life because it's in this horrible cycle of the same old same old and I feel about myself what do I need to know I think that the first thing is you can't tell me that your past was so brutal that you can't change cuz we have seen people with some really really horrible pasts abuses difficult childhoods some very serious traumas we have seen them change that belief and become completely different people but also the research shows that 50% of the story We Tell in our past isn't even the truth that means that people are reliving a miserable life they never even had just to excuse themselves from changing or they wait for something to go wrong in their life and that's when they go okay I'm ready to change why wait for that you know we can learn and change in a saate of pain and suffering can learn and change in a state of joy and inspiration and so I want to provide people the information how to make new Connections in their brain and be able to think act and feel differently in your same environment so let's break it down this has always blown my mind a little bit 53% of you that listen to the show regularly haven't yet subscribed to the show so could I ask you for a favor before we start if you like the show and you like what we do here and you want to support us the free simple way that you can do just that is by hitting the Subscribe button and my commitment to you is if you do that then I'll do everything in my power me and my team to make sure that this show is better for you every single week we'll listen to your feedback we'll find the guests that you want me to speak to and we'll continue to do what we do thank you so [Music] much Dr Joe how do you define when someone asks you what it is you do I teach people uh the neuroscience and the biology of what it really means to change and I think when we change our life changes so my interest is to demystify that process so that people have within their reach the tools to make measurable changes in their lives and what is that you're drawing upon what experiences what studies what research you drawing upon to give the world these Solutions I was interested really in the transcendental experience the transcendental moment um so when when I started teaching this work um I taught the work because people were asking how do you do it like how do you change your life and what does it mean to change and so I want to provide people the information uh where they can actually learn the information make new Connections in their brain that's what learning is repeat what they've learned to the person next to them you know build a model of understanding so you can remember it remind yourself what you've learned because it's so much easier forget this information then to remember it so create a new level of mind um take away all the doubt the conjecture the Superstition the dogma and so that the person can actually understand what they're doing and why they're doing so the how gets easier and when the how gets easier we assign meaning to the act because we understand what we're doing and when we do that we want a greater outcome so I want to give people the information and I com I looked at all the latest research that pointed the finger at human potential and human possibility I had my own personal experience with a personal injury we talked about it last time I studied spontaneous remissions I wanted to see what people had in common with each other and I couldn't find the explanation pretty much in contemporary uh uh texts I had to start looking at neuroplasticity and epigenetics and then I wanted to see well now that I know what people did and I understood what they did to have their own personal healings and transformation um could I reproduce the effects that no knowing what they did finding out what the commonalities were uh putting it in the language of Science and then teaching it to people they could be sick or they could be well it wouldn't matter but understand what they did in order for them to change and have their life change and after a couple years of teaching it we started to see kind of the same type of effects uh in those people that were applying and doing something with it so so this is a time in history where it's not enough to know this is a time in history to know how so when we started seeing people stepping out of wheelchairs and having dramatic changes in their health I knew that in some moment uh during the retreat or during their meditation that something happened to them they had an experience inwardly that must have changed them biologically in other words if you come into a an event and uh you have three days to be together and at the end of three days you're you're no longer in your wheelchair and you no longer have symptoms of MS that you know the the human being in me said wow that's amazing the scientists and me said how like how did that happen so that's when we started doing our own independent research and that's when I started calling in N scientists and um you know biologists and and Quantum physicists and and and really scientists to measuring it heart rate variability uh to look to see what was going on uh in people that were coming to our events so I could answer the question by saying now that the majority of the research uh that I look at is our own personal research and we have the largest database uh in the world now on meditation and the Mind Body Connection and what we do is we really work on demystifying the process of change and transformation and if we're able to demystify it I think all the all of the measurements of the transformation that we're seeing is more information for me to teach transformation better and I think that's how we close the gap between knowledge and experience so we have a huge research team we work with UC San Diego we work with other universities like Harvard Stanford and the data is so compelling uh and the data is so amazing uh that um uh I think we're making scientific history right now hundreds of millions of people have been drawn to you for their own reasons my partner is one of them my girlfriend she has attended your events she's she's one of your biggest fans in the world and she's experienced her own transformation as a product of attending your events but also last conversation if I look at the co top comments it's just a string of testimonials from people who have been engaged with your work for decades who have had personal transformation in their life in their family what is the essence of why people come to you like if you think about the hundreds of millions of people that have interacted with your work what do they have in common what is it they're looking for people come for all kinds of reasons the Baseline is that they understand on some level that that meditation can change their body and change their life some people uh understand that there's a that they could have mystical experiences without using any exogenous substances so we have people to come that come that want to heal their body that want to have a new job or a new career or become abundant people that want to have loving relationships some people want to have mystical experiences whatever that is right but the person is coming with the intention of actually creating exactly what they want so they that's the that's what they think they're there for but in time um what they're really coming for is to change uh and um even the people who heal from all kinds of health conditions what I learned in the last couple years is they're not doing their meditations to heal they're doing their meditations to change and when they change they heal and so what they begin to Crave is the next unknown experience you know that that experience that exists really Beyond three-dimensional reality but but I would say that the majority of people come for a particular reason and after a period of time they just want to get more whole and I don't think there's an end to that is there a bug in our minds or in our society or within culture that stands in the way of our ability to change and I think as I asked that question question what I'm really trying to get at is there's a culture that's emerged almost like a bit of a trauma culture where we we kind of explain who we are based on what's happened to us and it seems to be justified I this thing happened when I was a kid and that's why I am this way is that approach to viewing our trauma productive or unproductive and is it a problem the stronger the emotion we feel from some event in our life a trauma a betrayal a loss a shock um a diagnosis the the event produces an emotional response and the high quotient of the emotional response changes our internal State and the moment we feel altered inside of us the brain takes a snapshot freezes a frame or a series of frames and takes snapshots and that's called a long-term memory so then from a biological perspective every time the person rememb the problem they're producing the exact same chemistry in their brain and body as if the event was happening cortisol the adrenaline whatever the emotion is when they feel that emotion we could say then that the body is reliving the event emotionally 50 to 100 times in a day so the trauma is no longer in the brain at that point now the trauma is also in the body because thoughts are the language of the brain brain and feelings are the language of the body and it's that thought and that feeling it's that image and that emotion it's that stimulus and response that's conditioning the body subconsciously to become the mind of that emotion and now that person emotionally is a brand branded into the past and you can say to them why are you this way why are you so angry why are you so bitter why are you so mistrusting why are you so afraid and they'll say to you I am this way because of these events or that event that happened to me in my life 20 or 30 years ago now this is kind of an interesting thing because in a sense their identity is completely connected to their past and they as long as they feel that emotion uh they'll always remember the past so now the body is so objective when it feels that emotion it does not know the difference between the real life experience that's creating the emotion and the emotion that person is fabricating by thought alone so now the body's believing it's living in the past event 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year but what the person is really saying is after that event I haven't been able to change that's what they're saying and so that becomes the person's identity and there's nothing wrong with this but you'll never hear me say uh in any of the work that we do uh go back and process the past um uh we we've discovered that when a person analyzes uh their problems uh within the emotions of the past they make their brain worse they actually drive it further out of balance they're they're over arousing it we discovered is that if the person can get beyond the emotion truly get beyond the emotion uh they'll free themselves from the past and what we discovered is that if you teach a person to give up the fear the bitterness the resentment the frustration the impatience the Judgment you say stop feeling that emotion I know there's a reason why I'm sure everybody's got a story right so but there's nothing that's going to change that story until you change right and so we discovered that if you trade those emotions for an elevated emotion if you start feeling gratitude and appreciation and love and kindness and care and you practice feeling that emotion we give you some tools to to use to change your breathing to put your attention a a different place and to work with your body what we discovered is when the person can truly begin to open their heart and we have brain scans on this when the heart begins to open and it begins to become coherent in other words when you're feel feeling uh frustration or impatience or judgment your heart is beating very incoherently when you're feeling love and gratitude kindness and Care there's a rhythm there's a there's a Cadence that the heart has that's it's very coherent when the heart gets coherent we measure this it immediately informs the brain that the trauma is over the heart tells the brain the past is over the event is over and it resets the Baseline uh in the brain and so now the person when they look back at their past they're no longer looking at it from the same level of Consciousness in fact many of them will say oh my God I needed to go through all of that to get to this point right here they'll tell you they they'll they'll say I wouldn't want to change one thing in my past because it got me to the present moment okay so we work with Navy Seals special ops prisoners we work with people uh that have had some very serious traumas really serious abuses uh um uh just difficult childhoods uh these people are you know night terrors uh suicidal um can't you know leave their homes uh socially uh having trouble panic attacks it's kind of funny because the moment that person actually breaks through from the emotion and the words they typically describe was they say was like my heart exploded it's like my heart blew wide open the moment that happens they're bringing their body right out of the past right into the present moment and lo and behold many times there goes the anxiety there goes the depression there goes the cyclic mood patterns somehow the body uh gets recalibrated back into order back into homeostasis so the point I'm making is is that the memory without the emotional charge is called wisdom and now you're you're ready for the next adventure in your life the soul can't go to the next adventure if it's holding on to the past so we don't really ever address the story because the story is only firing and wiring the same circuits in the brain reaffirming the identity to the Past just to feel the same emotion and the research shows that 50% of the story We Tell in our past is is even the truth that means that people are reliving a miserable life they never even had just to excuse themselves from changing right I'm not taking shots at anybody but what I am saying is you can't tell me that your past was so brutal that you can't change CU we have seen people with some really really horrible pasts um that literally literally are are completely different people that have completely different lives I really want to focus in on what it is we're getting wrong when we're trying to treat trauma in modern society because I see all of these Retreats that are like inner child healing and they kind of take you back to when you were a young child the thing that happened to you whatever happened in your life and they kind of walk you back through it um there's also various types of therapy that make you kind of recount the events and then they ask you questions about it you're saying that you don't feel like those approaches are optimal because they just keep you in that circuit of living reliving the emotion no I I wouldn't say they're not optimal I mean I'm sure there's value for people all I'm saying is that um when does the story end and I'm not certain that Insight changes Behavior you could have a realization or even from an exogenous drug you can have a realization or an Insight but if you still can't function in your life and you're still you know you're haven't connected with your wife or you know you're still dealing with trauma it just hasn't served you at all like so the Insight that your your father was overbearing or your mother was a perfectionist or you were beaten as a kid uh and that's why you're this way it doesn't change the behavior let me give you an example then from my life because this will make it really specific so when I was young something I've talked about on the show but it's just an example that allows me to Think Through um your approach my mom and dad argued a lot and I would watch my mother in particular spend a lot of time shouting at my dad my dad didn't really respond he was very passive and it made me feel a certain way as a young child which meant that when I grew up I just wanted to avoid women all cost in terms of romantic commitment because I was almost reliving the emotion of imprisonment that I observed in my father so I felt like when a girl was interested in me throughout all of my teen years throughout my early 20s even if I was interested in her the minute we came to Commitment I'd get that feeling like I was signing up for prison and I would reject now I got an insight into this by writing in my diary actually from doing this podcast because I used to do it on my own just solo episodes and I could see a pattern I could see that someone asks me to commit I get this weird feeling I reject them and then I asked myself where did that weird feeling come from in your past and I remembered oh that's how I felt watching my father and my mom when she would just um scream at him for long periods of time I had the Insight which was somewhat useful but you're right in that it didn't necessarily stop stop the feeling but but what you did really well is is in order for us to change we have to become so conscious of those unconscious beliefs and what's a belief thought you just keep thinking over and over again or how you've been programmed right as a belief we have to become so aware of our automatic habits and behaviors and we have to pay attention to our emotional states if we're going to change and staying conscious of our unconscious self is is is really the the work that it takes to really overcome so you can become another person that's 95% of a person by the the middle of their life their you know hardwired attitudes beliefs and perceptions automatic habits and behaviors and unconscious emotional responses 95% of us as programmed so as a child your brain waves are um very slow the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind is wide open your brain waves are in Alpha and Theta and so you're very suggestible to to the information and so your exposure to that cause you to learn that that you know your observation causes you to get programmed to that the way life is by by Mir neurons looking at behaviors that are being programmed in you so so but that's not who you are right so the fact that you became conscious like oh my God I do this oh my God I see where I got it from okay that doesn't mean that that I'm going to excuse myself and say I can't be in relationships you could some people do that might be a different belief but they do that but you said I really want to have a meaningful relationship I really want to overcome this that is part of me that I want to change right so so you recognize that that's called metacognition right the the fact that you can objectify your subjective self and observe yourself that's Consciousness right and when you're conscious then that's when you're not unconscious and being unconscious is being in the program so how many times do we have to forget until we stop forgetting and start remembering that's the moment of change so you said okay that's uncomfortable that must mean something and you actually went on a a personal exploration yeah do something with the Insight with the provocation with the interest of actually wanting to change yourself in some way so that you create a a greater experience of life that there is love in life and that you can have a committed relationship and it could be different from your parents and now you know what you're not going to be right so I think all of that is valuable I think every experience that we have in our life that programs us to be a certain way sooner or later if we're if we're interested in arriving at the goals and dreams that we want there's we have to leave that behind sooner or later a part of us Must Die uh as sooner or later we have to leave that so I think you I think that's that's Evolution that first is the first step Insight like is this a a sequential multi-step process to change I think that I think Insight is an AS ECT of um awareness so is awareness States yeah so Consciousness is awareness and awareness is paying attention and noticing so I think that I think the first step is to become conscious um that we're a certain way and sometimes it lands as an Insight or a download or a life experience that just kind of goes you go wo like you know so I I I behaved this way or I did this thing so so I think I think when you you don't have that you don't have a conscience and you can just and you can just keep staying in that world and but but sooner or later uh you have to become aware how do I increase my awareness by paying attention is there a practice or a system or a process yeah yeah but what what we know is that that the the more you practice being present the better you get at it okay and so how do you do that if you sit in a meditation right and so there's a mode in the brain called default mode and it's just always busy it's consuming enormous amounts of energy in the brain and it's always trying to predict the future based on what it knows in the past it's a kind of an anticipation machine it's always trying to um fill in a known in reality so we feel safe so a default mode system in the brain when you close your eyes on a meditation is going going to immediately go into overdrive it's going to say oh my back hurts a little bit I'm kind of thirsty how long's this going to go I really don't want to do this I don't like the music you know uh is it's might be too long oh I'm starting to get a little frustrated I want to lay down you know all this stuff comes up and then people have the belief and they say I can't meditate that's that's their conclusion from The Experience that's their I'm not a good meditator that's their affirmation that's their belief right from that experience but if you say to a person listen that's normal but every time you catch yourself going unconscious catch yourself going unconscious and become conscious that's a victory and as tedious as it may be in the beginning the more you catch yourself going unconscious and becoming conscious the more conscious you become in your life and and all of a sudden you begin to pay attention to things that you weren't paying attention to before so in the work that we do we say that being in the present moment truly in the present moment is being comfortable in the unknown right the present moment is the unknown because there is the familiar past that we feel emotionally and we have the predictable future which are both the knowns being the present moment is being the unknown and that goes against thousands of years of programming because our biology is programmed that if we are truly the unknown we should be in survival because if you're in survival and you're in the fight ORF flight system the unknown is a threat it's a danger so always try to predict the future based on the past and you'll have better chances of survival predict the worst case scenario be ready for that anything less that happens you have better chance of surviving so then to rest in the unknown goes against a lot of our biology and we discovered that when a person keeps doing it over and over again the body gets agitated it gets frustrated it gets impatient instead of the person saying I quit give them something to do and they can lower the volume to the emotion and settle the animal down like training an animal setting settling the body back down into the present moment we we teach people how to do that and that's the victory giving them something to do yeah they have it they have something to do when that comes up okay which is I I'll get to it in a second and if they catch their mind going from a person to another person to another object to their cell phone to their computer to a place they need to be and you know a time and know their they catch themselves with their brain firing in modulated compartments if they keep catching themselves doing that if they keep doing that and they they catch the circuit when it's firing and they settle it down in time sooner later they're going to stop firing those circuits in the brain and their brain waves begin to change change from an agitated aroused State into a more coherent and slower brain wave state so when they do this enough times the brain begins to synchronize the brain begins to fire in Greater levels of wholeness or greater levels of order so when that occurs then the nervous system gets very regulated gets very orderly the autonomic nervous system moves into a state of regulation disregulation of the autonomic nervous system is called stress right so so to answer your question when people do this really well in just a few days they'll get really good at it the side effect of that is they get very relaxed in their heart it's relaxed in the heart and it's awake in the brain and the more relaxed you get in your heart we've discovered really relaxing into your heart the more the heart informs the brain to get creative and so now the person has this kind of synchronization that's taking place between their part in their brain as well and they can rest in the present moment so the way you do that is you define what it really means to change and to change is to be greater than the conditions in your environment to be able to think act and feel differently in your same environment that's what change is to change is to be greater than your body to be greater than its Dy lives in the meditation I'm speaking specifically greater than its emotional responses its memories its emotional reactions greater than its habits The Habit is when you've done something so many times the body knows how to do it better than the conscious mind there that's so so if you're sitting in a meditation your body wants to get up and wants to get going and got people to see things to do that's kind of like automatic right and people get up and they say I can't meditate but if you tell them that when you notice that you bring your body back into the present moment you settle it down and tell it it's no longer the mind that you're the mind you're training the animal sooner or later the body literally responds to a new mind and there's literally a liberation of energy the body begins to liberate energy and if the person's not thinking about time if you're not thinking about where you need to be where you need to go where you were yesterday where you're sitting where you live you know if you're not thinking about any place you can go from somewhere to nowhere and if you're not thinking about the predictable future or the familiar past you can go from sometime to no time and we discovered when a person becomes nobody no one no thing nowhere and no time they literally become pure Consciousness and opening our awareness I know this is kind of difficult to explain because we're materialists opening our awareness to nothing and sensing space tends to cause us to move more into the Eternal present moment and there's a change that takes place in the brain so we teach that and what awareness comes out of that state so if I'm looking to change my life because you know I'm continually performing habits that are not optimal you know I want to be married and have a family and I want to be productive in my work and I want to go to the gym and Etc and my life is just in this horrible cycle of the same old same old same old and I feel about about myself I know what I say I want but I feel about myself what's going to emerge from that process of deep meditation in ter of awareness you'll become so conscious of those unconscious habits that more than likely you won't want to do them again and that's what uh uh for the most part change is about so I think people wait for crisis you know they wait for disease they wait for a betrayal something to go wrong in their life and that's when they go okay I'm ready to change my message is why wait dude like why wait for that you know we can learn and change in a state of pain and suffering we can learn and change in a state of joy and inspiration so then you get a collective group of people together that really may have all those bad habits they they they may even have bad habits that they don't even know they have and then all of a sudden they become aware that they've been blaming and complaining and making excuses and feeling sorry for themselves and procrastinating and they start to reason if my personality creates my personal reality if I'm going to create a new personal reality I got to change my personality because this guy that that that's this isn't the guy that wants to be happy this is the guy who's committed to being unhappy okay let's break it down let's get down the fundamentals and now we give them a road map of their thoughts behaviors and emotions that that they have lived by is that step two person yeah you could say that step two is is becoming conscious of your unconscious self and then becoming conscious of a new self Reinventing a new self and so the person who's feeling really bad about themselves because they're not they're not doing anything to change it's just because um when you're not changing you're still choosing uh but what you're choosing is something that makes you feel familiar and comfortable because the moment you decide to change truly get serious about change the moment you decide to make a different choice and do something differently you are going to feel uncomfortable it's going to be immediate and that's the moment you go from the known into the unknown now if the body has been emotionally conditioned to be the mind like we talked about earlier the servant is the master and so the person who steps out into the unknown and it feels uncomfortable what is the body going to say get back to suffering get back to feeling bad get back to feeling guilty at least that's familiar that's known so tell a person there's going to be a biological death of the old self neurologically chemically hormonally genetically there's the old self is going to die just know that that's going to happen but instead of white knuckling it across the river of change we're going to give you something to do because that unknown place is the perfect place to create in so let's get you into the unknown but let's get you there where you're relaxed and awake you're not escaping and if you do that really well you're you'll be in a creative state so you actually will be out of survival and you'll be able to create because you could only be in survival or creation can't be in both so let's get your body physiologically back in the balance let's get it there now who do you want to be what do you want to believe let's review that what's a belief a thought you keep thinking over and over in your brain keep remembering to think this way in your meditation how am I going to be with my ex or my boss let me close my eyes and think about what greatness looks like what forgiveness would do what love would do let me just let me close my eyes and mentally rehearse how I'm going to be in that circumstance I'm going to keep remembering to do these things so I don't forget keep doing it over and over again you start installing the hardware repeat it enough times it gets like a software program you start behaving that way automatically and then my goodness is it possible to teach our body emotionally how we do want to feel before it happens in other words don't wait for your wealth to feel abundant or your your success to feel empowered or your healing to feel wholeness that's waiting for something in your outer World to Change to take away the The Emptiness or lack that you're feeling in your inner World teach your body emotionally what it feels like ahead of the actual experience and the moment you start feeling abundant you're generating wealth the moment you can embody empowerment you're stepping towards your your success the moment you feel grateful and whole be The Healing Begins right so now you're starting to cause an effect in your life so have the person keep remembering to feel that way and have them practice sooner or later they'll start feeling that way more and the more they feel that way the more they'll believe in their future and some people get so good at doing it that they walk around feeling that emotion they feel like their future has already happened and when you feel like the future has already happened you stop looking for it and that's when the magic starts to take place in people's lives the synchronicities the coincidences the opportunities they start coming to them in their life and and that's the reflection of their own personal change I've seen thousands and thousands tens of thousands of testimonials of people saying jod sper CH changed my life I mean I've got one at home right got a testimonial that I live with um I'm sorry no it's no honestly I I love it because she's so she's probably back there somewhere but she's so passate and inquisitive and curious that I almost vicariously am benefiting from the like work and research she's doing and she's bringing things into our relationship in life that are making it more rich and full and I have a certain perspective which I wouldn't naturally go into that world and even with breath work and the other things that she's brought into our relationship I wouldn't have naturally gone there so it's super useful but there must be instances where you've met someone and you've tried to help them and you've been unsuccessful of course and why don't those people change because I'm assuming that you think most people can change they have the propensity to change why does it not work sometimes and scientists asked me this you know we talk about this all the time uh sometimes uh being in such severe lack uh of and Desperation desperation you know uh creates a state where you can't hear anything um because you you don't you no new information can enter the nervous system that is not equal to the emotion the person is experiencing as an ex just as a broad understanding this is why we don't do questions in our events because you can give the person the answer to the question that they're asking you and they will not hear you they will not hear you in fact they will argue against you but if you get that person out of that emotional state and the only person that's going to do that is them by the way get that person out of their emotional state they can hear that information so sometimes we're programmed into such lack we're programmed right to wait for something out there to change to take away this emptiness or lack you know when this happens I'll feel this you know and so when things are good in our life we feel good and when things aren't so good in our life we feel bad so we're kind of victimized to the circumstances in our life it's our outer world is controlling our inner world of thoughts and feelings so if the person has been programmed into saying um I I I I I I why haven't I healed or why hasn't this happened in my life because the person who's saying why haven't I healed is the old self the new self would never say that right the new self is too busy overcoming and becoming right so I think people meet information uh at their own level but what I can tell you that is so compelling and so exciting is that when we get people on the stage and it happens every event it's it's really quite unbelievable to see a person stand on the stage in front of 2300 people you would walk right past her in the grocery store um she doesn't look vegan she doesn't look ketogenic she doesn't look particularly fit or young or dressed well you know whatever that is she just looks like a normal person and they stand on the stage and they tell their story of how they were diagnosed with cancer or um whatever the condition is and what they did uh in their life to change those health conditions and there's numerous health conditions when I look out in the audience uh and I look at people uh there isn't a soul in the audience that isn't leaning in everybody is leaning in because there's the example of Truth on the stage and there's nothing like a good story right so the change that we're seeing in our community is that there's a greater acceptance a greater belief a greater understanding a greater awareness to the idea that you could actually heal because people witness it and the person in the audience who's seeing that person who healed themselves from whatever health condition it is relates to them and they say my God if if that person can do it I can do it as well and just like an infection spreads amongst the culture and creates disease health and wellness can become as infectious as disease right and so we have it's not uncommon like when that person stands on the stage and they're the 4minute mile if the person as Renard's syndrome we've had events where four other people with reard syndrome healed at the end of the event like no longer have any symptoms at all or we've had five people in one event step out of a wheelchair now if you ask me if I ever thought that was possible I would say no so I do think uh when a person sees that example of Truth their awareness of possibility begins to change and um the evidence then allows the person to increase their own belief uh in in themselves and impossibility you used to add earlier on the the word identity and I've been pondering over the last couple of weeks whether identity is useful cuz this is a really trivial example but I've told myself for a long time I don't like running and this Christmas I decided that it's probably important for me to take on some of these limiting beliefs I have so I just started running and in doing so and going through the pain of like Oh my legs hurt whatever I had this sort of realization that like what other areas of my life have I just created a story that is closing in on me and making my life more narrow and uh in terms of how I think or like my health or whatever and and so for the last couple of weeks I've really been thinking about this concept of identity like what it is why we create one and how harmful or positive it might be to all of us yeah well look I mean I don't I think we're all a work in progress right I think it's an uncovering process so I I always tell people you can be anybody you want you can be any character you want to be in three-dimensional it in this in this kind of virtual reality experience you get to put on any character but when it comes time to create when it comes time to connect you got to lay down that character you got to lay down the identity you got to lay down that person right and some people are have become so uh uh idealized to their identity that they can't be anything else and so uh I don't think the identity is bad I think I think as long as long as we're able to to lay it down when we create it's important and by the same means if there are aspects of your personality or your identity that is undermining um your life in some way uh and this happens to so many people we see even with you know when they're when they're getting healings that they they their blood values get better and then they get back into their life and they blood values go back up and then they get more healings and their blood values go down and they go back into their life and sooner or later this goes on four or five times they say is it me like do I have something to do with this and and the answer is always yes if you if you want to take the sign you can't take you can't take one bite you got to actually eat the whole thing so so the so then what aspect of your identity then is limiting you uh and what is that story that you're saying to reaffirm it to be the truth and is it really the truth and if it's not the truth then you got to make a decision and you got to make a decision with such firm intention to change that belief that the amplitude of that choice carries a level of energy that causes your body to respond to your mind that the choice that you're making in that moment becomes a moment in time that you'll never forget in other words you have to say I knew exactly where I was what I was doing what time of day it was when I made up my mind to change right it becomes a long-term memory and the stronger emot the stronger the emotion you feel when you make that choice the more you remember the choice right and so you can't say oh well I think I'm going to change this kind of part of my identity and your your body's going to say he's lying like he's not serious he's going to still make the same Choice when you say this is it I don't care how long it takes time I don't care how I feel body I don't care what people think of me or what's going on in my life environment I'm going to change and you come out of your resting state and you make that choice you're giving your body a taste of the future emotionally that's what you're doing and so people who make up their mind to change they have to come out of their resting state and they have to say th I'm doing this and and that is a a strong signal in the field so does that mean that if I do want to change and I need that kind of escape velocity for my old self the why the reason must be abundantly clear incredibly strong so if I'm in if I'm making a New Year's resolution I'm not going to just say listen I I want this New Year's resolution because I think people will think better of me if I have it it's got to be so deep in my core and I've got to be so clear and be able to articulate the reason why this matters to me for it to stand a chance yeah we call that assigning meaning like so it's so important to assign meaning to the task or the act that we're uh engaging and one of the best way to do that is to hold that Vision or the dream of why you're doing it I want to be healthier I want to be more fit I want to be more wealthy I want to be more free I want to be more in love whatever it is the only thing that's stopping you from being any of those things is just a part of your identity that has to change so that you get there and it's nothing's mystical about this if you said I want to be wealthy this is your goal this is your vision and here you are in lack the only way you're going to get wealthy is this person's going to have to change a lot to find that wealth right so there's nothing there's nothing mystical about this we've all done it at some point in our life where we just made up our mind and and and what did we do when we when we did it we got very clear like okay uh let me remind myself what that vision is I just got to remember why am I doing this okay so I'm going to have to make a different Choice let me write down those choices I have to make I'm going to have to start doing different things okay what am I going to do let me remind myself what I need to do okay why am I doing it I'm doing for this experience yeah I know it might hurt my legs in the beginning or whatever it is I know it may be a little uncomfortable I'm going for this goal this is my goal and and and the more we Fascinate about that experience the more we start feeling the emotion of that future that's when your body what we've discovered is beginning to biologically change because it's starting to feel the emotion of the future ahead of time right so that keeps a person on the journey then we do something really great we say what what thoughts uh um do I want to stay away from like I can't say I there's no way I'm going to say I can't feel like it I mean if you're truly committed to being healthy and you're going to exercise you can never say I'm too tired you can never say I don't feel like it that's going to cause you to not make the choice right so it's kind of this process where we're kind of doing that exact thing we're actually looking at the old identity and we're we're reminding ourselves of who we want to become right and and until you become it and we discovered it's the overcoming process that is the becoming process when the person overcomes some belief some behavior um some emotion when they truly overcome it they naturally become somebody else it's it's just a side effect their their work in doing that makes them love themselves more you also have a lot of case studies of I was reading a a lot of them from army veterans and people that have been through pretty horrific experience in the Army I was reading a story of Joshua who was a army veteran who I believe came to one of your events and took part in your meditation and described it in his own words as his heart cracked wide open yeah what happened with Joshua because that's a good example of personal transformation well um we we have a program right now in the veterans the Navy Seals special ops um simply because there's lots of stories like like Joshua where um you know he was pretty much ready to give up on his life and many of these veterans you know they they they cope to the best of their ability but they in the back of their mind they have an exit plan they they have the drugs ready they're you know thinking about taking their life many of them think this way and they've done uh so many different um uh types of things to help themselves and even even a lot of them have done plant medicine and and mushrooms and you know ketamine and all kinds of things to help them but on some level their their PTSD U wouldn't doesn't go away and and Joshua is a great example because he was at the very bottom of the uh point in his life where he was ready to give up and you know the thing that I like to do with veterans is to reason with them if you have a if you have a a Navy SEAL right and these are Elite individuals if I tell them exactly what will happen if they practice opening their heart if if I say to them it's going to reset the Baseline for trauma in the brain they don't say how do I do it they say yes sir like I'm going to do I'm going to do it until it till it happens and that's what happens to all of these guys they're they get they're they there's so much trauma in their brain and body there's so much incoherence in their nervous system there's so many physical problems that they're having that they that they they they're just really out of balance so if we if we work with these people and give them all the information and give them numerous opportunities to apply it so many of them break through and that's the moment um their brain and body literally are no longer connected to the memory uh or or the emotion that keeps them in the past and and they get recalibrated and he was a drug addict an alcoholic a victim of child abuse yeah and the before and after of Joshua dramatic yeah dramatic um again you know we interview a lot of these veterans you know we did we interviewed this he didn't know anything about meditation this guy never meditated in his life you know he he didn't know anything about me and know he didn't even know where he was going this is how blind the study was and he got there and he was just like there's no way like I'm going to hang out with all these people you know he was really you know in and you know always on guard and they asked him in front of the camera like my goodness like what happened and he and like he got this is a guy that looks like a Navy SEAL and he paused for like a minute and he was got so emotional he said I I got my life back I got my life back I got every my marriage is great again I'm in love with my kids I can feel again I'm happy like I'm not faking it I really feel a change you know so that's how the vet the vet program kind of grew through because the veteran program was just a few vets coming that were again injured in some way physically or emotionally and completely different at the end of the event they're going to go tell their tribe like right away like you got to do this this really helped me so we have a strong veteran community and you know we have our one of our nonprofits the give to give Foundation that works with veterans and we create all kinds of programs for them to heal and and we're super proud of the results we're getting someone like Joshua has been through so much in their life where an objective Observer would say it is warranted that they might be living in a state of victimhood how important is it to forgive I think it's really uh one of the fundamental things that Keep Us Alive I mean forgiveness to me is just overcoming the emotion that's it and like if you overcome the emotion the side effect of that is that your heart will open that's exactly what happens and when en energy moves into the heart we start releasing different chemicals than we when we feel angry or we feel victimized or we feel sexual it's just a different chemical Elixir and oxytocin is released and oxytocin signals nitric oxide and nitric oxide signals another chemical that causes the arteries in your heart to literally dilate the heart gets filled with energy it's engorged with blood when that occurs the oxytocin level lels that you're feeling the love that you're feeling um the studies show that when oxytocin levels are just elevated a little bit it's really hard to hold a grudge you just can't right so if you're willing to forgive and you overcome the emotion you'll take your attention off the person or the problem right because the stronger the emotion we have the more we pay attention to our problems or the person right overcome the emotion you no longer have your attention on that person and in a sense you're taking energy and you're calling it back to you right so you're building your own field and so love is the Elixir that allows us to forgive in other words you can't say I'm going to forgive you it's uh January 31st or February 1st remember this day we got a thing I forgave you so that's not like forgiveness when people really have that feeling of pure love where they've actually gotten over the emotion they've already forgiven they're like I'm totally cool I'm great you great I'm great like so it's a side effect of a change because if the stronger the emotion we feel the more we pay attention to that person uh where we place our attention is where we place our energy okay overcome the emotion you no longer have your attention on that person you're calling energy back to you and you're building your own field and there's energy now to heal there's energy Now to create there's energy now for the mystical experience and so you can't do that if you're feeling frustrated or if you're feeling Ang anger if you're feeling resentment you'll always hold the grudge you have to convert you have to teach a person how to get into that elevated State and the side effect of that is forgiveness it's not something that you have to do it's just something that automatically happens when we think about forgiving people that have wronged us our dad when we were younger that person at work you the the boss that fired us or even something that happened that significantly worse it almost feels like a justification or an acceptance of what happened to us which makes it feel like there's an injustice in the world like if I forgive that person I'm letting them off yeah do you think we should always forgive everybody in all circumstances yeah I think so I mean because I mean you free yourself the only way you're going to free yourself from that person uh or from that past experience is for you to literally overcome the emotion so um God we've all had people do really horrible things and we've probably done some horrible things the people as well um but I don't think you can free yourself or free them unless you decide that um you know love is going to be the thing that heals it and and God so many people do it in our work and and the side effect of it is that they they they have wonderful effects in their lives many times just healing there is a chronic stress in society that seems to be going in One Direction it seems to be going up and up and up and I was wondering if that ties into the subject of burdens we're carrying from our past that are keeping us elevated in ways that are suboptimal yeah well I God I mean what a crazy time to be alive right now I mean there are so many things happening in such a short amount of time I mean it's almost overwhelming every day there's something happening and you know so living in stress is living in survival the problem with the stress hormones is that the arousal that's created from the stress hormones causes us uh to move into these higher brain wave States called beta brain wave states were aroused and the arousal causes us to pay attention primarily to all the things in our outer world the arousal causes us to put our attention on our body it causes us to obsess and think about time and so uh people get stuck in these uh High brain wave States and I think the big challenge is is if you understand that stress is when you're knocked out of homeostasis when your brain and body are knocked out of balance then your response or your reaction to people or circumstances in your life that you're chronically feeling on a regular basis is actually weakening the organism because when you turn on that emergency system the fight ORF flight nervous system because of the hormones of stress and you move your body out of balance and it has no time to recover and turn back to balance now you're headed for disease because no organism can live in emergency mode for that extended period of time the arousal creates a rush of energy and people become addicted to the stress hormones they become addicted to those emotions and so that now they need the people and the conditions and the circumstances and their life to reaffirm their addiction to the emotion they need the bad job they need the bad relationship they need the traffic they need the news uh just so that they can stay uh in that emotional state so then 75 to 90% of every person that walks into a healthcare facility in the Western World walks in because of emotional or psychological stress that's the number one thing so our emotional response uh to the conditions in our life then becomes the important element so people think oh my god um when I'm emotional I I can't control my emotions and turns out you can regulate it turns out you can uh shorten the response uh period from from emotions and it takes practice right so uh you could take the you could have the most ketogenic vegan organic uh peptide you know whatever intermittent fasting diet and you could do yoga and you can do cardio and you can do hit training and um you know foundation training and whatever uh get massage you know acupuncture but if you're an emotional wreck and you can't you know if there's three types of stress physical chemical and emotional then there's three types of balance physical chemical and emotional if you if you got your body in physical balance and chemical balance and you're not putting it in emotional balance these these will never stop day um so then the important part important element then is teaching people how to shorten the refractory period of their emotional responses and catch themselves when they're feeling those emotions and change it and not rely on anything outside of them to do it a video game or a drug or whatever people do teach them that they have the tools to do it themselves and if they understand that they're addicted to those emotions I've seen this thousands of times there's always an aha moment like I'm addicted to anger really oh my God maybe I am now the moment you recognize that oh my God I'm using that person to reaffirm my addiction to anger oh my God like I don't want to I don't want to feel anger okay well an addiction is something that you think you can't stop an addiction is uh doing something that you know isn't good for you and you're doing it anyway right so these emotions are addictive then I'm going to probably go through withdrawals I've probably overdosed a few times I've probably had a couple bad trips okay so let me get really clear like how am I going to change this so if to change is to be greater than your body your environment and time when you live in stress and you live in survival all your attention is on your body your environment and time it means when we're living in stress it's really hard to change MH because it's not a time to change it's time to run fight and hide right so so teaching people how to break those emotional addictions um is the side effect of that is called Joy a person is no longer tormenting their body in keeping it out of balance and many people who heal in this work they don't say oh I'm going to I'm going to heal this health condition they'll say the first thing I'm going to do and this is the majority of them is I'm going to work on getting my body back into homeostasis like I'm going to work on regulating my emotional states I'm not going to react in this way I'm not going to respond this way that's the work right there is breaking those emotional addictions so that we can move out of survival uh and in survival it's not a time to create in survival it's not a time to meditate it's not a time to close your eyes and go within you'd be eaten it's not a time to be vulnerable it's not a time to open your heart right and yet we got to work with our bodies and be able to to recondition them to a new mind and and so a lot of the work that we do especially during this time in history where everybody's feeling the the um the pressure the environmental pressure of stress is to give people the tools to be able to self-regulate and when I mean self-regulate that means move from one emotional state to another emotional state and it's not bad that we react we all react I react but the question is how long like how long are you going to react for because um if you keep doing it uh for months or years It ultimately becomes your personality right yeah and it has a big impact on your immune system I've noticed that when I'm in a state of prolonged reaction negative reaction to something it only takes a couple more days for me to get a flu or a cold or something and I H like because I don't get sick often so I think I get sick kind of like I am now maybe twice a year and so it's very easy it's almost like a shock and then it's very easy for me to trace my steps and see what brought me here so this happened my response was this 8 days later I felt my immune system go cuz I get sick so rarely it's so unbelievably clear what happened to me there's no like oh I I touched something and then the germs got in my mouth for me it's so clear in my life so yeah that's kind of what I I want to do is I want to stop that happening yeah well look how old are you I'm 32 32 my God you're doing great I mean if you figure this out now by the time you're 40 you'll you'll have it mastered um so we did a study where we had people stop feeling survival emotions uh for 3 days and have them practice feeling elevated emotions heart- centered emotions we measured uh a chemical called IGA immunoglobuline a it's your body's natural flu shot it's actually better than a flu shot and uh and so we measured people's IGA levels at the beginning of this time and then we measured them at the end at the end of 3 Days by trading those limited emotions for more elevated emotions their IG a levels went up 50% 50% so so when you're feeling an elevated emotion the body is so objective that it's believing it's living in an nurturing and loving environment if the environment signals the Gene and it does and the end product of an experience in the environment is an emotion that person is signaling genes ahead of the environment that's and now the body is going to make globulins which are proteins that are going to create more internal defense and uh uh uh and less and less uh attention on external defense so the immune system then which is the internal protection system begins to move back into order if you're looking to take the next step in your Tech Career you'll want to hear about our sponsor Inuit I've always believed that if you want to do your best work you have to put yourself in the right environment you want to work with the best you want to work with the best technologists who are leading Innovation with data and Ai and this is what you can

Toronto and around the world head over to in nit t/c careers to explore their opportunities what about routine in all of this is there value in having a strong routine because then when the winds blow at least I'm anchored by something yeah I try to avoid that word because I think it conjures up a lot of beliefs for people I I think I I'd like to say if you can set aside a certain amount of time for yourself just for yourself to be alone with yourself and for me um my routine is to have two hours in the morning that's just my time like that's my time where I'm going to get my brain and body right it's a time where I'm going to think about the things I have to do in the day and how I'm going to to be in my in my day get that all clear then I do my meditation and my meditation is really uh for me to overcome myself uh and change and then create and I you know I don't care if you do it in the morning or in the evening I'm a morning person I've always been a morning person I have friends that are that are artists and musicians even my kids they're just more even evening people they just they're creative so they like the evening doesn't matter to me I just pick a time in your day where you can think about who you want to be and who you no longer want to be and think about what you're going to change and and you know always make a little room for the unknown which is the fun part and and get creative yeah and so and our that's one of the things I'm proud of in in our community I'm really proud of the fact that people do the work like everybody does the work it's not like I have to make them do it and when I ask them like why like why do you do it every day aside from the majority of saying it makes me feel better they typically say I don't want the magic to end like there's too many good things too many good things going on in my life like I want to keep doing this it's working for me so it's kind of not like I have to it's a want to you talked earlier on about brain heart coherence it's a term that I've not heard before I didn't know that there was a connection between my brain and my heart oh there's a definite connection between your brain and heart yeah so we were so fascinated this was uh February of 2020 I'll never forget it we we started and our when we were doing our electroencephalograms you know our brain studies um we we put a a cardiac lead from the heart uh uh to the machine and we started looking at HRV in comparison to brain waves and coherence is rhythm right so when waves are kind of moving in Rhythm like this you can you can see that on the brain scan right they're these yeah they're very orderly they're very rhythmic like that so so if you think of waves that are Co coherent being very orderly and being very rhythmic um when they're when they're out of order like choppy and they different parts of the brain are in different rhythms that's when the brain's incoherent right and and so when we started looking at um training people how to broaden their awareness to sense space when you're sensing space the act of sensing and feeling causes you to stop analyzing and thinking and if you're not analyzing and thinking you start suppressing neocortical activity your brain waves start to slow down in beta you know you're aware that you're a body local in space and time that's low-level beta like we're talking right now we're in low-level beta if I said Stephen I'm going to give you a quiz um and you're going to have to take the quiz in front of your audience and you would kind of perk up a little bit your brain would get a little bit more aroused and the light bulb would get a little brighter and You' move into mid-range Vader that's like when you're going to give a speech or you're at a dinner and you don't know people you're kind of you kind of be a little bit more aware just for people that can't see this because they might be listening on audio so beta is uh conscious awareness now in beta the the brain is trying to create meaning between what's going on in the outer world and what's going on in the inner world and it's processing all the sensory information so a lot of data so beta is like conscious and awake and so there's low-level beta there's mid-range beta it's not on this chart but high level beta is when you're fearful when you're anxious when you're angry when you're in pain when you're frustrated when you're jealous whatever uh people get switched on in these high levels of beta and that's when we get overfocused you ever been under stressed and you start over focusing that's because you're you're you're narrowing your focus and you're over focusing and that's kind of a brain State and so when you broaden your awareness and instead of narrow your focus on something physical or material that's what the stress hormones do but if you broaden your awareness and you sense space and you this act of sensing causes you to no longer analyze and think and your brain waves start to move into Alpha now in Alpha which is this brain wave is a slower brain wave state that's the creative state of the brain the brain sees more in pictures more in images it's more imaginary right in beta there's a voice talking to you in the back of your head all the time saying this is right and this is wrong you got this to do you got that to do that's the critic kind of in our brain when you when you get Beyond beta brain waves and you move into Alpha you start opening the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind now we're not just looking for any type of alpha but we're looking for coherent Alpha so we want all those compartments that we're firing in different rhythms and different frequencies all of a sudden start doing this so now the whole entire brain starts moving into what's called Global coherence now when the brain starts synchronizing like that what sinks in the brain starts to link in the brain and the whole brain starts to fire as one neurological Network and that's what our data shows now that's not the end that's just when you're moving into an imaginary State and people do this but but a lot of people move into Alpha but it's not coherent so we're looking for a coherent Alpha now many of the people that are meditating really well they can relax their body so well and they can feel so safe that their body moves into a light rest or a light sleep while they're still awake so it's relaxed and awake in that realm you're in a hypnotic State you're in feta brain waves and in Theta now lights are shut out in the thinking Neo cortest that plugs us into three-dimensional reality the identity is gone the character is gone there's no activity there now the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind is wide open to information and now we're suggestible to information and now we're in the operating system we can get in the subconscious mind and rewrite a program we could rehearse a new script we can tell a new story instead of the story of the past we can tell the story of our future and we can Pro program our subconscious mind and our autonomic nervous system to begin to change our biology now go too far past Theta and you fall into Delta and now lights are out you're in a catatonic State and you're unconscious right and so we kind of do this when we go to bed at night we go from beta to Alpha Theta to Delta and if you're under stress and you're in high beta you can't sleep and you can't sleep because you're thinking right and you can't drop through brain waves when you wake up in the morning you go from Delta to the Theta to Alpha to Beta right so there's two times that the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind opens up okay what does this have to do with brain and heart coherence well in Theta when a person is in that state where their attention is on their heart and energy is in their heart it's natural for the heart to tell the brain to get creative it's time to imagine it's time to fall in love with a future now the heart is the creative center right right it's the it's the part of the our biology that that allows the brain to begin the frontal lobe to begin to create so you get the heart and the Brain kind of working together the more relaxed you get in your heart the more awake you get in the brain Something Beautiful happens in the brain if the person can sustain this and they're in that Theta State Theta becomes the carrier wave and right within the brain you start to see Alpha Waves building on theta waves and then alpha waves in harmonics into beta waves and harmonics into high beta and then High beta ultimately into gamma and now the person is relaxed and very awake because gamma is superconsciousness it is super awareness so the the formula of being relaxed and awake and synchronizing your heart to your brain causes the brain to move into a state of what's called resonance and resonance is when you have w waves on top of waves harmonics and the Brain starts functioning in a more resonance State sometimes even people have Delta as the base carrying Theta and Theta carrying Alpha and Alpha carrying beta to high beta to gamma and they're all waves within waves and as those waves come together if they're if they're coherent they interfere and create a bigger wave and then those waves come together and they interfere and they create bigger waves and that's exactly how the energy in the brain goes up so we have brain scans of people who whose gamma brain waves are 200 300 400 standard deviations outside of normal I'm going give you an idea three standard deviations outside of normal is 2% of the population so they're they're processing an enormous amount of energy in their brain and it feels really good really good so we practice a lot synchronizing the heart to the brain if you do like MDMA or something does that put you into some of these brain waves I'm wondering if any psychedelics are inducing of these states we're going to do a comparative study actually um this year with psychedelics and meditation I can I can answer that question more definitively what we do know from fmri studies with psilocybin is that the default mode Network in the brain the one I was talking about earlier that's always the brain's predictor that that shuts off in a in a with with a psilocybin and that's exactly what we see in our our our Advanced meditators and our fmis that those people that are having a mystical experience right in the MRI looks like they're taking psilocybin the same exact the same exact brain circuits are turned off on this um Theta wave you talking about how that's really where a lot of the reprogramming can happen so do I need to be in that state and then be exposed to some kind of stimulus sound good question good question um well I'll answer in three ways first way is when you're conscious in your subconscious mind and you're trained to imagine whatever it is that you want you're going to begin to Signal your autonomic nervous system to start manufacturing chemicals equal to your intention in other words the intention of whatever you're thinking about acts as information that begins to change your biology so Theta is a great way to open up the door we also use Theta um when we want to program people because it's a hypnotic state to a mystical experience and if they're in that state remember when you're suggestible you accept believe and surrender to information as if it's the truth without analyzing it and that's what programs people's biology right so you can program somebody into believing they need a drug and you can program somebody to believing in just about anything but you could also program them for a mystical experience and that's what we do now so we can do that by giving them information when they're in that hypnotic state they're very suggestible but we're only going to do it in a way that's going to be beneficial to them and then the Third Way is something that we really discovered that we weren't expecting let's see how I can say this and make it simple um there's particle and wave there's matter and energy and so if your all of your attention is on this three-dimensional World um you're you're unaware of energy so have a person close their eyes and take their attention off of everything physical everything material everything known and go from a narrow Focus to a broadened focus and as they sense the space they're actually putting their attention on that invisible field of energy that exists beyond our senses the quantum field right and that field is carrying an enormous amount of information so when a person moves into Theta and I ask them to open their awareness if they're in a certain range of theta we can just about predict 100% of the time that that person is going to connect to information now not information coming from their senses like a hypnotist could put you in a trans and Theta and give you suggestions and you could program you but you're still in the same state that hypnotic state but your eyes are closed there's music playing in the background you're not eating you're not tasting you're not smelling you're not feeling with your body but you're still suggestible to information there's only one other place you can find information and that's frequency and frequency carries information so when a person starts to connect to energy to frequency and the thinking neocortex is dialed down the moment they connect to that energy and frequency the brain goes into these very very high states of gamma brain wave patterns they're connecting to a greater level of energy a greater level of order and they arousal that's felt when they have this connection which is normally typically fear or anger or pain the arousal is ecstasy the arousal is bliss that's the they say I don't have the words to describe the feeling that I just had right so they're dipping Closer To Source they're dipping closer to a greater energy and frequency and it's being reflected in their biology when we see people move into these elegant states of high gamma it's primarily in their autonomic nervous system it's very fast and it's very coherent now if stress is autonomic disregulation and they're functioning in a very very high energetic state in their autonomic nervous system coherent gamma brain waves then there's an enormous amount of autonomic regulation and the autonomic nervous system controls and coordinates all other systems now watch watch out because now the tuning fork is sending information to every cell and tissue and organ in the body and when people move into these states many times when they come back they get a biological upgrade somehow Energy starts to inform matter and the whole body is lifted by light by lifted by frequency when we when we draw the blood from people who who have these kind of moments we look for information in the blood there's information in the blood that we've discovered that stops the covid virus from entering the cell we've isolated the protein that inhibits the virus from entering the cell in other words we've done the studies called adoptive transfers we've taken Advanced meditators blood and we've put it in U a culture with A2 receptors cells that have A2 receptors and then expose the A2 receptor to the to a pseudovirus like a CO virus and in advanced meditators we noticed that the virus couldn't enter the cell it was stuck to the outside of the cell and we isolated a protein in the advanced meditator blood that inhibits the virus from entering the cell those people that have those transcendental moments as I said 84% of them 84% of them have information in their blood that causes the mitochondrial function and glycolytic function in cancer cells to shut off there's information in the blood for neurogenesis uh for um the microbiome completely changed at the end of 7 Days completely different microbiome uh without changing their diet at all they're still eating the same food but they're not the same person right there's some kind of change that creates a lot of probiotic microbes I remember reading a study of um whm Hof the ican where they injected him with a virus and I think they injected other people with the virus and through his breath work and meditations and whatever else he did the virus didn't infect him but it infected the other people and then I think in the study they he trained other people to be able to reject the virus as well and all of this kind of sounds a little bit woooo to the average person because to think that you can do something to prevent a virus infecting you I mean it blows the doors open to like personal responsibility and yes of course you know which is yeah troubling for people I think yeah well we published the paper um it got published in a scientific journal um people can see it online um well if you keep practicing being greater than your environment you'll be greater than your environment that's that's just how it is in other words if your response to your environment doesn't weaken you but strengthens you then the innate intelligence of your body will have an intelligence that will cause you to be greater than your environment right down to the microb and that is where you keep referencing the term advanced meditator cuz you don't say normal meditators well what I will say is I'll say well it's kind of funny when I use that term I can only use that term because many people that come to our weekl long Retreats Stephen they're they're novices they've never really meditated before their spouse or their boyfriend or girlfriend brought them or their co-work or their friend or you know they're just kind of like whatever you know I don't really know what I'm getting myself into the novice meditator who just kind of practices a little bit that goes through the immersive experience at the end of s days their brains look like Advanced meditators at the end of seven days their biology their blood values look like they've been meditating for years in other words at the end of seven days those Advanced medit those meditators that were novice meditators that look like Advanced meditators are upregulating thousands of genes in their biology to suggest that they're living in a whole new life a whole new environment and they're in a ballroom and there's nothing very stimulating about a ballroom so whatever they're doing inside of them inside of themselves somehow is causing dramatic changes now we looked at we looked at a group of people we looked at their genotype and genes make proteins and your gene expression is different than mine different than every single person so everybody has their own unique genotype which means they all make their own individual proteins at the end of seven days when we looked at those meditators at the end of seven days almost 80% of the population was making the same genes and the same proteins they were signaling the same genes and making the same proteins what does that mean that means when people behave in the same way there's an emergent Consciousness that comes forth that's reflected in people's biology the flock the herd the tribe everybody's evolving together biologically at these Retreats these 7-Day retreats one of the things I was pretty shocked by was the amount of time people spend meditating yeah how long do people spend meditating and why is that important our events are a spiritual Rave I me that's the best way I can describe it I mean we start at 6:00 in the morning and we finish at 700 or 8 at night and the days go by extremely fast there's standing and walking meditations we do sometimes four or five of them sometimes six at a weekl long event why because you got to embody you got to get really good at doing it with your eyes open um we do laying down meditations after we get people to a certain point where I know they're not going to fall asleep when they lay down and so and then we do some big uh meditations that are that are a little bit more longer but people are up and down the whole entire time none of the meditations will ever be done without knowledge beforehand because knowledge is the precursor uh to the experience so so it's it's an immersive experience um yeah turns out to be about 35 hours of meditation when it's all said and done but you ask anybody who does a weeklong event they'll say I'm so I have I can't wait to get back into my life and start my practice because I what I was doing when I got here was nothing like I'm doing now right so now they're more equipped and really they're they're kind of in a different body they're walking back into a new life and you know they're they're not on the same line of time any longer that's the experience that I can profess to be true in my own relationship and life because my partner came back from the medit the meditations she came back from the week in Miami where she was doing the walking meditations down the beach and so on and it didn't stop there in fact that was really the start of her journey because every morning now she has this new routine where she meditates in the morning and no one's telling her to do that but clearly the benefit has been so great for her that that she's continued the the the practice and she does it every day it's I'm like I'm so amazed by it because it takes a there must like it takes a certain I was going to say the word discipline but it's not discipline because if you're so clear on the the benefit of an action you don't necessarily need like discipline it's just clearly done so much for her that she's continued to do it thereafter and it's funny because obviously she she came back from it I was supposed to attend I had a Visa issue she came back from it and told me about the process and her recounting it like objectively you go God that must have been hard and uncomfortable or that must have been whatever but her experience was very much the opposite it was joyous it was filling she came back so unbelievably obsessed with this new set of sort of systems and information that could better her life and it's really it's really profound like you can hear it on a podcast but then when you kind of witness it in someone someone you know well in love it's incredibly persuasive yeah well that I mean that's what I want I want people to walk out into their life and not say you need to shorten the refractory period of your emotional responses you need to forgive you need to get your brain or heart coherent I don't I don't want anybody in my work to do that I want them to walk out into the world and be the example so so much so that people go what what's what's what's up with you you're different like I you know you're you seem different you know what is it you know and that's when I think the real conversation starts so that's a that's that it's instrumental when it becomes instrumental and you apply it to your life and it's working for you is it's not a have to as I said it's something that you really enjoy doing and uh wow what what a crazy Sovereign idea that you could actually make yourself happy what a crazy idea when you when you hit those gamma moments where you feel a level of love you have never felt in your entire life by connecting the source which is pure love and you stop looking for it outside of you you start realizing it's within you that's a big moment right because then you won't you won't need anybody or anything that's that's Freedom that's unconditional love right you'll get out of want use that that time a few times yeah yeah I mean like like want like we we've been trained to create based on lack that's what we do in threedimensional reality in threedimensional reality you see someone that that has a sports car and you don't have one and you like that sports car all of a sudden you want that sports car your brain starts creating based on lack of of not having it you see a someone in a scarf and you like that scarf and next thing you know you're wearing that scarf your brain imagines you having it right but the way we get it in threedimensional reality is we have to do something this is the plane of demonstration so then when we finally get the scarf and we finally get the car the experience of getting the car produces the emotion that takes away the lack or separation of not having it so some people spend their whole life in lack waiting for the thing to come around to take away the the feeling of lack or separation right my message is not that my message is actually to create in a different way in such a way that you feel like it has already happened now the power behind all of that is that the person now who's who's who's in that state where they're feeling like the event has already happened they no longer want it because they're feeling the emotion what how could they they wouldn't be looking for it you only look for it when you experience lack if you feel like it's already happened you're no longer separate from it and we cannot attract anything in our life we feel separate from and so feeling that emotion somehow starts to draw things to us and now we're not having to do anything and things are starting to come to us that's the synchronicities that's the coincidences that's the opportunities we're not doing anything they're coming to us and that's so so you can't when you create from that Quantum field instead of from matter you can't create from lack because the thought of your wealth in the quantum produces the feeling of abundance the thought of your wealth and three-dimensional reality for many people produ is the lack of not having it so the in the quantum there's a whole different set of rules and and it's not something that you know you learn right away it's you learn from trial and error so so then when we create truly create in the act of creation and we are creating from the field instead of from matter to shorten the distance between the thought of what we want and experience of having it the only way that we can do that is we can't create from lack so in the creative process we create from wholeness my conern when I hear that is well Jo if I no longer want if I no longer live in a state of want am I going to have the motivation to get up and go because I look at my life and go well it was your creating from a place of lack that motivated you to start a podcast and to start run businesses and do all of these things and get a car and whatever else no I'm not disputing that I think I think you do that for a while you do that for a while and I I always tell people I don't care what you want to create I just want you to get really good at creating I don't care if it's I don't care what it is wealth I don't care what it is car you know whatever it is vacations houses I don't care just get good at creating but sooner or later that the novelty will wear off on all of that and you you you'll want to know that on some level there's more so so you we always desire things we always want things but when we're in the creative process we cannot create from the lack of not having it we have to create from the feeling of having it right and so in the quantum you got to feel it to experience it this one change has transformed how my team and I move train and think about our bodies when doctor Daniel Lieberman came on the DI of CEO he explained how modern shoes with their cushioning and support are making our feet weaker and that's capable of doing what nature intended them to do we've lost the natural strength and mobility in our feet and this is leading to issues like back pain and knee pain I'd already purchased a pair of Viva barefoot shoes so I showed them to Daniel liberman and he told me that they were exactly the type of shoe that would help me restore natural foot movement and rebuild my strength but I think it was plti fitis that I had where suddenly my feet started hurting all the time and after that I decided to start strengthening my own foot by using the Viva Barefoot and research from Liverpool university has backed this up they've shown that wearing Vivo barefoot shoes for 6 months can increase foot strength by up to 60% visit Vivo barfoot.co.nz / doac use code do ac20 a strong body starts with strong feet quick one I want to talk to you about our sponsor whoop a business I'm also an investor in and if you follow me on Instagram you probably noticed that recently I've picked up running which I'm very much enjoying and it started out as a challenge but it's now evolved into something I do almost daily it is one of those things that's pushing me to be better every single day but here's the thing to me progress isn't just about pushing harder it's also about training in a smarter way which is where my whoop comes in whoop doesn't just track my workouts it tells me how ready my body is to take them on before I've even started the workout a few years ago we ran a study called project PR and it found that Runners who adjusted their training based on their recovery scores improved their 5K times by an average of 2 minutes and 40 seconds while reducing injury Risk by over 30% and they did it while training less so if you're looking for this type of guidance when it comes to your train training head over to join. woop.com CEO and get a 30-day trial with zero commitment that's join. woop.com let me know how you get on when you say in the quantum oh I was hoping you wouldn't go oh God because people are going to hear you say that and they're going to say I wonder what he means by the quantum okay the probability that we're perceiving the truth of reality is zero that that there's more information in the inmaterial than there'll ever be in the material and that information that exists in the inmaterial that the the senses cannot perceive the senses can only perceive three-dimensional reality objects and things and places and people and bodies there's an invisible field of energy the the atom is both particle matter and wave or energy right but all we see is the material element and the atom is 99.999999% information and energy and 0000000000 1% matter so the brain has been shaped and molded from Generations Untold in living in Survival by narrowing our focus on the material world the stress hormones heighten our senses and when we our senses are heightened we become materialist so live in survival for thousands and thousands of years energy is not important when you're being chased by T-Rex uh energy is not important when you're looking for food right you got to narrow your focus and and so the brain cannot perceive energy or frequency so what we're seeing is really symbols or just out picturing of the most stable form of energy called matter and our senses collapse it into what appears to be material but the quantum field is that other field of energy and information that exists beyond our senses Beyond this material world whose signature is Oneness his signature is wholeness who signature is connection whose signature is love pure love and so if you spend your whole life with all of your attention on your body your environment and time all of your attention is in this three-dimensional reality then you got to play by the rules and the rules are Newtonian physics you got to predict everything it's going to take time and energy for you to get everything you want in your life okay you can get really good at that you can get really good you can get skilled you can get trained you can get coached you can learn you can go to school you can learn from your mistakes you can gather a lot of things you get really good at that but is there another way to create okay well Einstein said the field the wave the energy is the sole governing agency of the particle energy controls matter he didn't say the particle controls the particle he said the field control controls the particle if you change the information in the field can you change the projection the particle in three dimensional reality this is a holographic Universe okay so if the if the quantum field is an invisible field of energy that exists beyond our senses beyond our body our environment and time then the only way we are going to connect to it is take all of our attention off our body all of our attention off the environment what's the environment made of people objects things places and and take all of your attention off of linear time the predictable future and the familiar past and find The Sweet Spot of the generous present moment that's the unknown that's the door that's the moment you become nobody no one no thing nowhere no time that is the moment you are pure Consciousness and it's no different than me saying to you stay alive I'm going to take away your eyesight I'm going to take away your hearing I'm going to take away your smell I'm going to take away your taste I'm going to take away you feeling with your body and if I take away all of your senses who are you your Consciousness right your Consciousness consciousness of what nothing nothing but what you and the act of becoming conscious of nothing and becoming nobody no one no thing nowhere and no time is the eye of the needle and that is the moment you're walking through the door to the quantum field and when you walk through that door the game changes it's all energy it's all frequency it's all vibration it's all connected it's all thought it's all Consciousness it's all information right and so you got to train your brain like when you pass through you're not you any longer you're not your body any longer you're your body here your pure Consciousness and that void or that vacuum or that nothing whatever you want to call that is rich in frequency and energy so have people linger there without a name without a skin color without a gender without a diet without a face without a past without a social security number without a profession without being a mother father a kid linger there as pure Consciousness lay the the character down and get comfortable in nothing in the unknown okay now that you're there if it's all frequency and it's all energy then the next thing we have to do then is get our brain coherent because thought is the electrical charge it's the impulse in the quantum field and the feeling the elevated emotion is the magnetic charge if you take a thought and a feeling an image and an emotion a vision of the future with a coherent brain and a coherent heart you got a whole new Wi-Fi signal now you're broadcasting new information into the field and you're connected to this field keep changing the information in the field you're going to change the destiny of your experience in matter and so we teach people how to get to that place get their brains and hearts coherent and learn how to create by changing the information in the field to ultimately create the experience they want in three dimensional reality and when there's a vibrational match between their energy and some potential in the quantum field and they're creating from the source of everything physical why would they go anywhere to get it if you're the source you would draw to you so then creating from the field instead of from matter can literally shorten the distance between the thought of what you want and the experience of having it instead of going and having to do something to get it it starts coming to you and that's another way to create and again it all starts with getting out of the future in the past and into the the overcoming process the first couple days is Val more valuable than all the gold in the world for people though they'll say oh my God I had such a terrible story I had such a belief oh my God I just I was so addicted to those emotions they'll tell you and they just have you just have to sit with yourself long enough to no longer want to feel that way and we just give people the tools to get them from the old self to the new self to cross that River it's quite compelling idea that I might be addicted to negative emotions or emotions that aren't productive to me in any way even that as an idea well take the idea like this if you were angry right now or you were feeling sad and I came up to you and I said Hey Stephen listen I know you're really miffed right now I know you're feeling really down whatever um but just stop just stop getting just stop being there just stop if you can't stop that then on some level you must be addicted to it right if you if you truly were not addicted to it you would be able to just turn it off right so so when people start to see that they're like oh my god um yeah I could be addicted to that it's a good moment for people what's it doing for me well the long-term effects of doing that I mean we can turn on the stress response just by thought alone you could think about your problems and you could produce the same chemistry as if it was real the long-term effects of the hormones of stress down regul genes and create disease and if you can turn on that stress response just by thought alone that means your thoughts can make you sick if I know it's bad for me like no one wants to feel sad so why am I choosing to feel sad there's nothing wrong with feeling sad it's just how long you want to stay there or angry or fearful I don't want to feel that yeah so again here we go trial and error you got to catch yourself and you got to go because because when you're feeling sad as an example or you're feeling angry or whatever for the most part uh you want to stay there many people like it's just comfortable it's it's some people find a lot of comfort in being unhappy they're really happy being unhappy so so if you want to evolve your experience in life you would say I can change this I literally can change it let me sit down and change my emotional state if this emotion is causing me me to view my reality through the lens of the past if this reality is downregulating my genes and creating disease if this reality feeling this emotion is causing me to behave as if I'm in a past reality if a feeling this emotion causes me to believe in my past more than my future H maybe it's not s such a good idea that I stay there so so Justified or not valid or not the only person that that emotion is affecting is you sooner or later I think when people start realizing I can change my emotional state and they really sit down even though they don't want to do it they do it that's when they start feeling a lot of worth Joe what is the most important question based on all of your work and all that you do and all that you're thinking about at this exact moment and the subject of change and transformation that I should have asked you oo is it possible that the human nervous system the autonomic nervous system manufactures a pharmacy of chemicals that works better than any drug is it possible that the human nervous system manufactures a pharmacy of chemicals that works better than any drug Joe the answer is absolutely yes that's what our data shows and it's not pseudo science our data shows that the autonomic nervous system can manufacture a pharmacy of chemicals that works better than any drug a drug trial is about uh uh 25% effective one out of four people have a response and it's normally over a length of time 60 to 90 days what our data shows is that 75 as I said 84 90 95 100% of the people that are involved in a 7-Day event have these effects so even if it's 75% that means it's working three times better than any drug and yet your nervous system is manufacturing those chemicals equal to the person's state of being equal to their intention and and I keep telling I keep asking the scien is where are those chemicals coming from the person's not eating a pill they're not changing their diet they're not doing anything and yet what wasn't there before the event somehow is there after the event it's coming from within us is that because of some of the sort of techniques and the processes you go through at the event is it because of the connect of a group of people coming together and synchronizing and the oxytocin is it all of the above it's all of the above I mean almost 80% of the people expressing the same genes and making the same proteins that's unheard of what we discovered is people change people that's what we disc we discovered that Collective networks of observers determine reality and it's not the number of people it's not the amount of energy it's the most coherence that takes place in the in the group and so we're doing studies now with with Collective networks we're doing studies and measuring the effects of collective Consciousness what does that do uh uh in terms of field effects and and energy when you say all of this and you talk about this relationship between the body and the mind it um it keeps making me wonder about your beliefs of a higher power or a God because it all sounds I mean the more and more I learn about the body and how interconnected it is it all sounds just mystical it's the only way to describe it so I wondered as you were speaking I wrote down on my a lipad here I said does Joe believe in God I do I do I think there's one God but in that one there's many yeah what is that mean that means that means that God Lives within you the Divine lives in every human being that's what I believe and I think it's really important for people to make time for it to connect to it to fall in love with it to stay aware of it to bring it into their life by staying aware of it and connecting to it and I think the more we interact with it I think the more it becomes us and the more we become it and so removing the veils the blocks the emotions the habits the blind spots that stand in our way between our connection to that unifying field or God or the absolute or the Creator or universal mind or Source or Singularity the zero point field the fertile void whatever you want to call it the motherf father principle making time to interact with it by removing the things that stand in the way between us and it allows us to get closer to love right and I think that's what God is so the expression of the Divine the expression of God through the human being would be a a person that's more conscious more mindful more willful more loving uh um um more giving that's the nature of the Divine so its nature becomes our nature right so I do believe that um we're not linear beings living a linear life I believe that we're dimensional beings living a dimensional life and and I do believe in that Universal uh mind that Universal Power and and making time to use it and to interact with it and connect with it and to reach for it and to become it um I think it's a worthy Journey for people thank you so much for the work that you do it's a perfect sort of combination of all the things that I think I care about but also I think my audience care about and if they are looking to go deeper Beyond this podcast I would highly recommend them trying to get a ticket to one of your events very hard to get tickets to your events so good luck to you but I would highly recommend they go to your website and they can see a full list of events that you have coming up there because it can be um from as I've learned from my partner truly transformational in ways that maybe will surprise them if you can find I'm reinviting you I need to do it it's been been something on my mind you should just come just for fun you I promised you'd have the best week of your life I know I know I just see the I see the impact you had on M my girlfriend and I just I'm jealous of it it's the best way to describe it nice I am jealous of it thank you so much good kind of jealousy the hardest conversations are often the ones we avoid but what if you had the right question to start them with every single guest on the DI of CEO has left behind a question in this diary and it's a question designed to challenge to connect and to go deeper with the next guest and these are all the questions that I have here in my hand on one side you've got the question that was asked the name of the person who wrote it and on the other side if you scan that you can watch the person who came after who answered it 51 questions split across three different levels the warm-up level the openup level and the Deep level so you decide how deep the conversation goes and people play these conversation cards in boardrooms at work in bedrooms alone at night and on first dates and everywhere in between I'll put a link to the conversation cards in the description below and you can get yours at the diary.com this has always blown my mind a little bit 53% of you that listen to the show regularly haven't yet subscribed to the show so could I ask you for a favor if you like the show and you like what we do here and you want to support us the free simple way that you can do just that is by hitting the Subscribe button and my commitment to you is if you do that then I'll do everything in my power me and my team to make sure that this show is better for you every single week we'll listen to your feedback we'll find the guests that you want me to speak to and we'll continue to do what we do thank you so much a [Music]
